## Description:

vuejs test.

## Current Version:

0.0.1.

## Author:

Aziz Gharbi.

## Notes:

`Recently i am only working with react and it's been a while that i didn't use Vuejs (more than a year) so if there is new features that i didn't implement, I may be outdated. Anyway fundamentals are forever shinny libraries are short term.`

## Developments:

- In case of watching files failed with webpack please update webpack `Global version -g`.
- I am using `Live server` extension on vs code to browse the html file and for hot reload.
- You can run `npm install` to install packages.
- You can run `npm run watch` to start webpack watcher.
- You can run `npm run dev` to build, or `npm run prod`.
- You can open the `index.html` directly to see the demo.

### ps:

- To use the search type your text then press enter.

## Technologies:

- [buefy](https://buefy.org/) (ui framework for vue js based on bluma css).
- Vuejs.
- webpack (Module bundler) plugins [@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining).

## Why?

`I used only vuejs and webpack to generate the full application. because i didn't find the need to use (vue-cli,vuex,vue-router for only two screens), Basically i am using : vuejs + customized webpack config`

## Cons:

- without vue-router we don't for example have the ability to send a specific link for a site details.
- without vue cli and it's awesome webpack pre-config, code splitting, typescript and more ...

## Problems:

- Sometimes the Api don't return the images. as you see in the first screen.

## Nice to have:

- Typescript.
- [vue-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vue-styled-components) to avoid overriding css classes.

### Finally:

- I really enjoied the test: build with love for javascript, And i am looking forward to seeing you, your feedback are reaaly welcome.
